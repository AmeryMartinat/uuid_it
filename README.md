# UuidIt

You need to assign UUIDs to your Model? Simply uuid_it by adding one line of code.

For actually generating the uuids this plugin uses spectra's ruby-uuid (http://github.com/spectra/ruby-uuid) whih is
based on ruby-uuid (http://raa.ruby-lang.org/project/ruby-uuid/).

## Installation

### As a gem
    Add the following line to your config/environment.rb file:

      config.gem "uuid_it"

    script/generate uuid_it
    rake db:migrate
