# UuidIt

You need to assign UUIDs to your Model? UuidIt makes it as simple as adding one line of code to the according models.

For actually generating the uuids this plugin uses spectra's ruby-uuid (http://github.com/spectra/ruby-uuid) whih is
based on ruby-uuid (http://raa.ruby-lang.org/project/ruby-uuid/).

## Installation

### As a plugin

    script/plugin install git://github.com/aduffeck/uuid_it.git
    script/generate uuid_it
    rake db:migrate

### As a gem
    gem install uuid_it

Add the following line to your config/environment.rb file:

    config.gem "uuid_it"

Then

    script/generate uuid_it
    rake db:migrate

## Usage

    class Car < ActiveRecord::Base
      uuid_it
    end

    @car.uuid # "9e5edacc-7163-11df-92bb-2d0a2c4dcb1c"

New UUIDs will be assigned when new objects are created. Already existing objects will get a UUID when it is read for the
first time.
